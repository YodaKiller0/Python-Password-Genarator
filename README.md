# Python-Password-Genarator

This Python code generates random passwords with a user-defined length and quantity. It imports the "random" module, which is used to randomly select characters from a string that includes letters, numbers, and symbols. The code uses a while loop to prompt the user for password length and quantity. It then generates a series of random passwords based on the user's input using nested for loops. Finally, it prints out the generated passwords to the user. This code is useful for creating secure passwords for a variety of applications.
